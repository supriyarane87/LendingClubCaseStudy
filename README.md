Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to **â€˜riskyâ€™** applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). **Credit loss** is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. ### Project Statement &gt; Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company. ### Data Set &gt; The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club. ## Conclusions - Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss: 1. DTI 2. Grades 3. Verification Status 4. Annual income 5. Pub_rec_bankruptcies - Other considerations for 'defaults' : 1. Borrowers from large urban cities like california, new york, texas, florida etc. 2. Borrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000. 3. Borrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy. 4. Borrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk. 5. Borrowers with very high Debt to Income value. 6. Borrowers with working experience 10+ years. ## Technologies Used - Pandas - version 1.3.4 - NumPy - version 1.20.3 - Seaborn - version 0.11.2 - MatplotLib - version 3.4.3 - Plotly - version 5.7.0 ## Acknowledgements This project was inspired by UpGrad IITB Programme as a case study for the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
